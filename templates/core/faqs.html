                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">1. What types of prosthetic services do you offer?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">We offer a comprehensive range of prosthetic services including upper and lower limb prosthetics, custom-designed prosthetic limbs, activity-specific prosthetics for sports and recreation, and advanced prosthetic technologies like microprocessor knees and myoelectric hands.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">2. How long does it take to get fitted for a prosthetic limb?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">The fitting process typically takes 4-6 weeks from initial consultation to final delivery. This includes measurement sessions, test fittings, and adjustments to ensure optimal comfort and function. Complex cases may require additional time, while simpler devices can sometimes be completed more quickly.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">3. What are orthotic devices, and how do they help?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Orthotic devices are external supports applied to the body to improve function, restrict or assist movement, reduce pain, or correct deformities. They include braces, splints, and specialized footwear. These devices can help manage conditions like foot drop, scoliosis, arthritis, and sports injuries by providing stability and proper alignment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">4. Are your services covered by insurance?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">As a Private Limited Clinic, our services are not covered by insurance. We offer various payment options and flexible payment plans to help make our services more accessible. Our administrative team can discuss available payment options and help create a payment plan that works for you.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">5. How long do prosthetic limbs last?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Prosthetic limbs typically last 3-5 years with proper care and maintenance. Factors affecting lifespan include activity level, body changes, growth (for pediatric patients), and general wear and tear. Components like sockets may need replacement more frequently than structural components. We provide regular maintenance services to extend the life of your prosthetic.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">6. Do you offer services for pediatric patients?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Yes, we have specialized pediatric orthopaedic services for children of all ages. Our pediatric team understands the unique challenges of treating growing children and creates devices that can be adjusted as they develop. We provide supportive care for conditions like clubfoot, limb differences, scoliosis, and developmental issues.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">7. What specialized footwear options do you provide?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">We offer custom diabetic footwear, therapeutic shoes for arthritis and foot deformities, orthopedic inserts and arch supports, post-surgical footwear, and sports-specific orthotics. Each option is designed to address specific conditions while ensuring comfort and reducing risk of injury or complication.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">8. What should I expect during my first appointment?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Your first appointment will include a comprehensive evaluation of your condition, medical history review, physical assessment, discussion of goals and expectations, and explanation of treatment options. We may take measurements, photographs, or casts if needed. The initial consultation typically lasts 60-90 minutes, allowing time for questions and concerns.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">9. Do you provide rehabilitation services with prosthetic fittings?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Yes, we offer comprehensive rehabilitation programs tailored to help patients adapt to their new prosthetic devices. This includes gait training, balance exercises, strength building, and daily living skills. Our physical therapists work closely with prosthetists to ensure optimal comfort and function through the adaptation process.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">10. How do I care for my prosthetic or orthotic device?</h2>
                <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Proper care includes daily cleaning with mild soap and water, regular socket hygiene, keeping devices dry, checking for wear and damage, avoiding extreme temperatures, following weight limits, scheduling regular maintenance checks, and contacting us immediately if you experience discomfort or fit issues. We provide detailed care instructions specific to your device.</p>
